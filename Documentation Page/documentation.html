            Media Exposing Limited Time (MELT) is a large-scale immersive audio/visual art experience 
            that invites participants to explore the theme of climate change by combining large interactive
            projections, web-based interfaces, and Augmented Reality.
          </p>
    
          <p>
            Featuring original content built-in visual programming software TouchDesigner, MELT employs 
            multiple projectors, projection mapping techniques, and motion-sensing input devices to 
            transform the 3200-square-foot Enhanced Immersion Studio ASU’s world-class Media and 
            Immersive eXperience (MIX) Center in Mesa, Arizona. It will immerse users in a future-oriented 
            environment designed to engage the community in meaningful, collaborative, and empathic 
            discussion of environmental issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            Attendees will have the opportunity to manipulate the projected environment via a custom-built 
            website that translates messages to a node-based visual programming language in real-time.
          </p>
          <ul>

                Participants are encouraged to download the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hoverlay/id1207928666" target="_blank">Hoverlay Augmented Reality app</a> to 
                take advantage of the full experience,

                MELT is the final project developed by the students from the D551 Immersive Experience 
                Design course led by Ana Herruzo and Weidi Zhang, a new course offered for the first time 
                at ASU MiX center. The class is made up of a wide array of interdisciplinary students, 
                with diverse backgrounds such as artists, architects, software developers, researchers, 
                and designers.

          </p>
          <p>
            We have built a website as a front end interface to interact with the system by providing an 
            ability for the user to select scenes out of the four avaialble scenes.
            The selected scene data is then passed to the TouchDesigner control panel in the form of JSON data 
            by including the scene name and the scene code.

            <br>
            <br>

            Below is the workflow diagram of the data from the website to TouchDesigner.

            <br>

            <div class="col-lg-8" id="lottie animation">
              <script>
                var animation = bodymovin.loadAnimation({
                  container: document.getElementById('lottie animation'),
                  path: 'workflow diagram lottie.json',
                  render: 'svg',
                  loop: true,
                  autoplay: true,
                  name: 'animation'
                })
              </script>
            </div>

            <br>

            The website packs the selected scene data into JSON and sends the data to Heroku server where the server side
            node js code is executed. The server code dynamically listens to the data sent through websocket and then passes 
            the same to the touchdesigner control panel, which is programmed to continuosuly receive the JSON data from the server.

        <p>The topic of environmental stability is a constant thought among humans no matter their 
          generation, culture, or involvement with the living world around them. MELT creates interactions 
          that bluntly show humans how we directly impact our surroundings no matter how abstractly we view 
          them. This immersive experience leaves those who interact with it haunting thoughts of “Will this
           all still be here in the future, or will it MELT away?”</p>

            <span id="bold">SPILL</span>  <br> <br> An explosive visual that engulfs the user in an oil spill of contrasting colors.
             When oil spills it consumes every inch of surroundings and organisms around it with deadly 
             speed. By exposing this fossil fuel, which is so essential to humans, users will see the 
             deathly effects it can have on a larger scale.

             <span id="bold">STORM</span>   <br> <br> The shock and shake of thunder followed by an instant 
             strike of light will awaken users to the unnatural recurrence of thunderstorms. The earth’s 
             rise in temperature has awakened the sky to rain down shattering sounds and deadly light more 
             frequently than ever before. The user will immerse themselves in a field of lighting to see 
             how dangerous the sky has become in recent years.

             by water. The oceans are being oversaturated with the water of once solid glaciers which will 
             soon consume more land than ever before. Users will wade through a predicted watery environment 
             based on the projections of what is soon to be a landless world.

             breathes life into the earth. Users will quickly see their impact on coral reefs as it retreats 
             into the depths of nonexistence from human’s touch.
