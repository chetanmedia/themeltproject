    <div class="bg-text-spill">
      <p>An explosive visual that engulfs the user in an oil spill of contrasting colors.
        When oil spills it consumes every inch of surroundings and organisms around it with deadly 
        speed. By exposing this fossil fuel, which is so essential to humans, users will see the 
        deathly effects it can have on a larger scale.
      </p>
    </div>
     
    <div class="bg-text-storm">
      <p>The shock and shake of thunder followed by an instant strike of light will awaken users to 
        the unnatural recurrence of thunderstorms.
        The user will immerse themselves in a field of lighting to see how dangerous the sky has become in recent years.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="bg-text-melt">
      <p>Slide across the liquified flooring of a world consumed by water. The oceans are being 
        oversaturated with the water of once solid glaciers which will soon consume more land than 
        ever before. Users will wade through a predicted watery environment based on the projections 
        of what is soon to be a landless world.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="bg-text-underneath">
      <p>An organism that provides so much life above and before the sea level, 
        coral is slowly fading away. A giver of food, shelter and life coral breathes life into the earth. 
        Users will quickly see their impact on coral reefs as it retreats into the depths of nonexistence 
        from humanâ€™s touch.
